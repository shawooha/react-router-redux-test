# React/Redux Junior Developer Test

The point is to show your basic react/redux/router abilities, redux store and PropTypes usage.

## Test task

Make a react app with the following pages:
/ - home
/login - login form
/news - just news (show news from an array)
/profile - user profile, inaccessible when user is not logged in

Make a nav bar with the following links: /, /news, /profie, and login/logout link (button)
If a user goes to /profile and he's not logged in - redirect to /login
Login form accepts fake login/pass:
username: Admin
password: 12345

Show PropTypes usage on at least one of components.
Styling is not necessary, but you may use your favorite css framework or react components.

## Run
	npm start
